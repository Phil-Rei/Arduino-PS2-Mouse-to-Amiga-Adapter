## You will need:

  - Arduino (Nano/Uno/Mini/...)
  - PS2 Mouse (or USB mouse that can be used with an usb-to-ps2 adapter)
  - Female DSub9 (to plug into the Amiga)
  
## Connect:
```
  PS2 Mouse         Arduino Pin
  CLOCK              D11 
  DATA               D12
  5V                 5V
  GND                GND
  
  USB Mouse (PS2 Compatible like Cherry M-5400)
  CLOCK              USB PIN 3 -> D11
  DATA               USB PIN 2 -> D12
  5V                 USB PIN 1 -> 5V VCC
  GND                USB PIN 4 -> GND
